# Concentration exam ENARSI 300-410

Exam Description: Implementing Cisco Enterprise Advanced Routing and Services v1.1 (ENARSI 300-410) is a 90-minute exam associated with the CCNP Enterprise Certification. This exam certifies a candidate's knowledge for implementation and troubleshooting of advanced routing technologies and services including Layer 3, VPN services, infrastructure security, infrastructure services, and infrastructure automation. The course, Implementing Cisco Enterprise Advanced Routing and Services, helps candidates to prepare for this exam.

The following topics are general guidelines for the content likely to be included on the exam. However, other related topics may also appear on any specific delivery of the exam. To better reflect the contents of the exam and for clarity purposes, the guidelines below may change at any time without notice.
